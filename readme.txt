I built the simulator to run from the command line, using command line arguments.


To run it with Static Branch Prediction Assuming Taken use:
$ python simulator.py <filename>



To run it with Static Branch Prediction Assuming Not Taken use:
$ python simulator.py <filename>



To run what I had of Branch Prediction use
$ python simulator.py <filename>



filename must include the file extensions, e.g. $ python simulator.py gcc_branch.out
